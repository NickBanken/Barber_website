# Barber_website

This website was made in my spare time. I have searched for a local business, of which website could use a makeover.
The next step for this website is to create it with Vue.js.

**Note:** The images used on this website are placeholders and are not ment for commercial use.

*Possible fixes:* find a better solution for the parallax images to scale with the screen width.
